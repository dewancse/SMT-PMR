            <span>The first step is to discover entities in PMR relevant to your interests. The discovered entities
                  are typically components or variables in CellML models, but as the annotated content on PMR continues
                  to grow the pool of potentially relevant entities similarly grows. With our current focus on epithelial
                  transport in the kidney, this demonstration is tuned toward the kinds of entities most commonly found
                  in models of such systems - e.g., fluxes of solutes typically found in renal epithelial cells (sodium,
                  potassium, ammonium...) and processes occuring in, or between, the lumen, cytosol, and interstitial compartments.

              compartments and anatomical locations. As can be seen in the screenshot below, Weinstein and
              Mackenzie models have common compartment.

        <span>This platform has been semantically generated and visualised based on the collection of models
              in the LOAD MODELS page. Following screenshoot illustrates the generated modelsâ€™ component with
              circles, polygons and line with arrows. This platform consists of three membranes: apical, basolateral
              and capillary; and five compartments: luminal, cytosol, paracellular pathway, interstitial fluid and blood
              capillary. Each of these has been depicted with a unique color on the top-right corner of the platform.

        <span>As part of the additional information available for the discovered entities, a recommender
              system has been implemented to present the user with additional entities in PMR that may be
              of interest. As with the rest of this tool, the recommender system is currently very renal
              epithelial transport focussed, but the implementation will be easily extendable to a wider
              range of physiology as the available semantic knowledge in PMR grows.
