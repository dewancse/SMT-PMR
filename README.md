A web-based epithelial transport discovery, exploration, and assembly tool. Researchers can search for models such as specific transport proteins, solute species, or other relevant information. SemGen (http://sbp.bhi.washington.edu/projects/semgen) have been used to comprehensively annotate a preliminary cohort of epithelial transport models available in Physiome Model Repository (https://models.physiomeproject.org/welcome) to provide an initial knowledgebase for use in developing and testing this tool. One use of such exploration is the identification of missing resource(s), which could be addressed via more accurate description of existing resources or the addition of new resource to the repository.
