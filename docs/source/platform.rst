Modelling Platform
==================

This platform is generated from the discovered  models in the “Load Models” page. Following screenshoot 
illustrates semantically generated solutes on a specifc membrane. This platform is comprised of two 
memebranes – apical and basolateral, and four compartments – luminal, cytosol, ineterstitial fluid, and 
paracellular pathway. Each of this has been presented with a  unique color on the top right corner. 

Concentrations of the models will be floating around on a specific compartment and the fluxes will be 
placed on specific membrane based on the annotation. From the schreenshot, we can see the direction, 
e.g. Na+ and Cl- are flowing from luminal to cytosol compartment in the NaCl cotransporter. Single 
fluxes and cotransporters have been represented with circles and channels have been represenetd with 
polygons, where as diffusive fluxes in the paracellular pathway have been presenetd with a text followed 
by an arrow. On the right side, we have generated checkboxes on the right side for each of the fluxes. 
Modellers’ can drag and drop existing fluxes onto the other membrane. For example, modellers’ could drag 
and drop the NaCl cotransporeter ontobasolateral membrane and afterwards this platform will render some 
useful suggestion, which we call recommender system, discussed in the next section.
