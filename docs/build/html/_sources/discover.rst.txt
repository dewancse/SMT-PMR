Discover CellML Models
======================

Modellers will search solutes based on their requirements. Presented below screenshot is an example of 
discovering flux of sodium from the Physiome Model Repository (PMR). Modellers can see various options 
such as CellML model entity – name of the model, component name, and variable name; biological annotation 
deposited in PMR for discovery; protein name; and species and gene used for models’ experiment. The view 
option will provide detailed information of a specific model. If modellers are happy with their model, 
they will click “Add to Model” and can come back here to discover new models.
