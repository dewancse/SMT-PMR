Load Discovered Models
======================

After discovering a range of models, user will enlist them in the “Load Models”, as presented below 
screenshoot. We have provided here various options: “view” option to get more information on a 
specific model, “delete” to delete model(s) if user is not happy with, “visualisation” to get a 
comparison between models. In addition, we have provided two more useful information: compartment 
and location, for a quick view. If user is happy with the discovered models in this page, these models 
will be generated as SVG in the platform through the “Epithelial Platform” option.
