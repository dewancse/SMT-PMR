Epithelial Modelling Platform
=============================

Epithelial modelling platform is a web-based epithelial transport discovery, exploration and assembly tool. 
User can use this tool to learn how to develop a new epithelial model from the very begining. Firstly, they 
will discover models of interests and choose various components from the discovered models. Later, these 
models will be semantically visualized on the SVG based epithelial modelling platform. User can also 
rediscover models and append more models on this platform. If they are satisfied with a certain arrangement 
of the models, they will then send these models to a model assembler called GMS. After assembling the models, 
GMS will provide a new model with an URI. Novice modellers could use this platform as a learning tool.
