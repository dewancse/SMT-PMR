Epithelial Modelling Platform
=============================

Epithelial modelling platform is a web-based epithelial transport discovery, exploration and assembly tool. 
Novice modellers could use this tool as a learning material and could develop a new epithelial model. 
Initially they will discover models and choose various components from these models, and will visualize them 
on the SVG based epithelial modelling platform. They can rediscover models and append more models on the platform. 
If they are with the settings, they will send these component toan server called GMS to asseble these components. 
GMS will assemble these models and send back an URI with a new model.
