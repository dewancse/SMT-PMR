Recommender System
==================

We have provided a smart recommender system for the user to discover more models from PMR. This system will 
appear as a window when user will drag and drop a model from apical to basolateral or vice-versa. Presented 
below is an example of “flux of sodium” in the weinstein model from apical to basolateral model. The system 
will provide a brief description of the dragged model followed by some suggestions from PMR. In this case, 
user will get more available basolateral membranes with the sodium solute. Also, alternative models of this 
model from various workspaces, and related kidney models have been provided for further exploration. Tooltip 
options have been provided to give more information to user, as well as with link to CellML workspaces to get 
a detailed description of the models. User can choose one of the models from this system as a repalcement of 
the dragged model and this change will be reflected in the SVG platform. Otherwise, user can simply click save 
option without replacing models from the recommmender system.
