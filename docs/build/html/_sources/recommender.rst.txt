Recommender System
==================

We have provided a smart recommender system for the modellers’ to discovera nd explore more knowledge resources 
form PMR. This window will appear when modellers’ will drag and drop a solute from apical to basolateral or 
vice-versa. Presented below is an example of flux of sodium of the weinstein model from apical to basolateral model. 
The system will provide a brief description of the dragged model followed by some suggestions from PMR. In this case, 
modellers’ have more basolateral membranes with the same solute, i.e. sodium. Also, alternative models of this model 
from various workspaces, and related kidney models. Tooltip options have been provided to give more information to 
modellers’, as well as link to the CellML workspace to get a detailoed oveview of the model. Modellers’ could choose 
one of the models here for a repalcement of the dragged model and this will be reflected in the SVG based platform. 
Otherwise, modellers’ could simply click save option if they are happy with the dragged one on the opposite membrane.
